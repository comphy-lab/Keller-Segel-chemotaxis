# Project Instructions

- Keep `basilisk/` local-only; do not commit or delete it unless asked.
- `.project_config` is generated by an install script and is required for builds.
- Simulation entry points live in `simulationCases/` and are built with `simulationCases/runCases.sh <case-name>`.
- Outputs go to `simulationCases/<case>/`; do not modify or delete outputs unless explicitly requested.
- Use `src-local/` for project-specific headers and helpers.
- Place analysis scripts in `postProcess/`.
